Defect ID: LIB-APP-101 (Hypothetical Jira Ticket)
Title:Application crashes with NullPointerException when scrolling 'My Books' list exceeding 50 items.
Environment: QA Environment v1.0.0; Android 12, Pixel 4a.
Priority: High
Severity: Critical (S1)
Reporter: [Your Name]
Assignee: Development Team

Description:
The application terminates unexpectedly when a member navigates to the 'My Books' section and scrolls through a list containing more than 50 books. This blocks the user from accessing their core account information.

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in to the application with a Member account that has more than 50 books checked out (e.g., use test account stress_member_01).

From the Dashboard, navigate to the 'My Books' section.

Quickly scroll to the bottom of the list.

Observe the application freeze for 2 seconds, then crash with an "App Not Responding" dialog.

Expected Result:
The list should scroll smoothly, utilizing lazy loading if necessary, and display all checked-out books without crashing.

Actual Result:
The application crashes, forcing the user to restart it.
