2. Session-Based Test Management Notes

Session 1: The "Rushed User"

Data: Used guest checkout, autofilled address.

Test Notes:

(+) Autofill worked perfectly for address fields.

(-) Bug Found: On the Payment page, the "Place Order" button remains enabled even before all fields are filled. Clicking it does nothing, with no error message. Heuristic Violation: #5 Error Prevention.

(-) Observation: No progress indicator (e.g., "Step 2 of 3"). User doesn't know how many steps are left. Heuristic Violation: #1 Visibility of System Status.


Session 2: The "Fussy User"

Data: Applied promo code WELCOME10, then removed it. Changed shipping method from Standard to Express.

Test Notes:

(+) Cart updated prices correctly when promo code was applied/removed.

(-) Bug Found: After changing the shipping method on the Review page and going back, the selected method reverted to Standard. Heuristic Violation: #3 User Control and Freedom (User's choice was not remembered).

(-) Observation: No "Continue Shopping" link on the Cart page. The only navigation is "Proceed to Checkout" or the browser's back button.
