Project 1: The "First Principles" Test - Local Library Mobile App
Concept: Test a brand new, minimal mobile application for a local library.

This project focuses on the absolute fundamentals: dissecting requirements, designing test cases from scratch, and executing a structured test cycle.

A Quality Project: It forces you to build a test suite from the ground up, emphasizing requirement analysis, test design techniques, and clear bug reporting without the crutch of an existing application.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Requirement Analysis & Test Planning
The "App": An app with two user roles: Member and Librarian.
Member Can: Log in, Search for books, View book details (title, author, status: Available/Checked Out), Check out a book (if available), View their checked-out books.
Librarian Can: Log in, View all books, Add a new book, Update Books status( Checked-out or available), Mark a book as Lost.
Create a Test Plan:
Objective: Ensure the core functionalities of the Library Mobile App work as specified for its initial release.
Scope: Functional testing of Login, Search, Book Management (Check-out, Mark as Lost), and Role-based access.
Out of Scope: Performance, Security, Compatibility with different devices/OS versions (To do a basic check).
Strategy: We will use a combination of Positive, Negative, and Boundary testing.
Entry/Exit Criteria: Entry - Build is delivered by devs. Exit - All Critical/High priority bugs are closed; Test Case pass rate is >95%.

Step 2: Test Case Design
For the "Login" feature:
Positive Test: Valid username + valid password -> Successful login, correct home screen based on role.
Negative Tests:
Invalid username + valid password -> Appropriate error message.
Valid username + invalid password -> Appropriate error message.
Empty username/password -> Appropriate error message.
Boundary Test: Enter a password with 255 characters (if there's a limit).
For the "Check out a book" feature:
Positive Test: Member searches for an "Available" book -> Clicks "Check Out" -> Book status changes to "Checked Out" in system, book appears in member's account.
Negative Test: Member tries to check out a book already "Checked Out" -> System displays "This book is not available" message.
State-based Test: What happens if a Librarian marks a "Checked Out" book as "Lost"? Does the member's account update?

Step 3: Test Execution & Defect Reporting
Execute your test cases. 
Write a High-Quality Bug Report for a simulated issue : 
Title: [Member Home] Application crashes when user attempts to scroll through a list of more than 50 checked-out books.
Description: When a member has more than 50 books in their 'My Books' section, scrolling to the bottom of the list causes the application to force close.
Steps to Reproduce:
Log in as a member (e.g., user: member1, pass: pass123).
Ensure the account has more than 50 books checked out (you may need to use a script or a test account set up by devs).
Navigate to the 'My Books' section.
Scroll to the bottom of the list.
Observe the application crash.
Expected Result: The list should scroll smoothly, loading all items.
Actual Result: The application crashes with an "App Not Responding" error.
Severity: High (Application crash)
Priority: High (Blocks user from accessing their core data)
Attachment: Add a screenshot of the error or a screen recording.
